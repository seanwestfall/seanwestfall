I'm a bit of a space case (hence the image above), but it's because I'm always thinking about programming languages. My favorite languages are [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Golang](https://golang.org), [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).  

See my portfolio to see some sample applications: https://github.com/seanwestfall/portfolio  

I also like making programming languages for fun, check out some of them:

I am also into yoga 🧘, surfing 🏄, drinking tea 🍵, and reading books 📚. And I'm trying to get in photography 📸.
